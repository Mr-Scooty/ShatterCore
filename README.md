# ShatterCore

## Introduction
ShatterCore is an open-source game server application and framework designed for hosting massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), and it is based on the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft (WoW) and seeks to recreate the gameplay experience of the Cataclysm expansion. 

The original code is based on [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore) and [The-Cataclysm-Preservation-Project](https://github.com/The-Cataclysm-Preservation-Project), and this project serves as a continuation of their work up to game patch 4.3.4.

## Long-term Goals

Adoption of the [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) philosophy.

Our main goal is to create a playable game server, offering a fully working in-game experience.

Here are the main points we focus on:

- **Stability**
    - We make sure all changes pass the CIs before being merged into the master branch.

- **Blizzlike content**
    - We strive to make all in-game content to be blizzlike. Therefore we have a high standard of fixes being made.

- **Customization**
    - It is easy to customize your experience using modules.

- **Community driven**
    - ShatterCore aims to build an active community of developers, contributors, and users who collaborate, share knowledge, and provide support through forums, Discord channels, and other communication platforms.
